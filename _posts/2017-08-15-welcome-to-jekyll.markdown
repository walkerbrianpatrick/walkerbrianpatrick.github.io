Obligatory 'this website under construction'

Posts seem pretty easy here. I'm sure there is a way to do this in an IDE, but it's neat to make this from scratch.

{% highlight python %}
import antigravity

ac = antigravity.controller()
me = person
ac.apply_gravity(me,[0,0,0])
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
make measandwich
#make: *** No rule to make target 'measandwich'.  Stop.
sudo make measandwich
{% endhighlight %}

Linking seems pretty easy: [This is a Link][https://www.google.com]
I can also do it with references [This is a different Link][another-link]

You can check the source for this website [here][web-sauce]
